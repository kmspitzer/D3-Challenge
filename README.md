# D3-Challenge

Kate Spitzer    collaboration with Rick Spitzer

The D3 challenge tasked us with reading in a CSV file containing 2016 US Census Bureau data and creating an interactive scatter plot written with javascript and D3.
The plot has 3 choices for x-axis data, % subjects In Poverty, Median Age, and Median Household Income, and 3 choices for y-axis data, % Lacking Health Insurance, %
Smokers, and % Obese.  When clicking on one of the axis options, the plotted circles will trasition to reflect the new datapoint.  Each plotted circle on the graph
will display the 2 character abbreviation of the state the data represents.  On mouseover, a black border is visible around the plotted circle, and a tooltip box is
displayed, indicating the state name, and the current axis names and data values.

Inputs:
assets/data/data.csv


NOTE:  State abbreviation text labelling code was located on the Stack Overflow community forum and modified to render the labels, and shared by
Annette Broeren and Kevin Mickey.
